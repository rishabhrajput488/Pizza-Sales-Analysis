Pizza Sales Analysis using SQL and Power BI

I have analyzed the Problem statment using Power BI and also from SQL just to verify the results. You can download the video file I've attaced to get a glimpse of the interactive dashboard I built.

Problem Statement
KPI’s Requirement – We need to analyse key indicators for our pizza sales data to gain insight into our business performance. Specifically, we want to calculate the following metrics:

•	Total Revenue - The sum of the total price of the pizza orders.

•	Average order value – The average amount spent per order, calculated by dividing the total revenue by the total number of orders.

•	Total Pizza sold – The sum of quantities of pizza sold.

•	Total Orders – the total number of orders placed.

•	Average pizza per order – The average number of pizzas sold per order. Calculated by dividing the total number of pizzas sold by the total number of orders.

Chart Requirements
We would like to visualize various aspects of our pizza sales data to gain insights and understand key trends. We have identified the following requirements for creating charts.
1.	Daily Trend for total orders: Created a bar chart that displays the daily trend of total orders over a specified period. This chart will help us identify any patterns or fluctuations in order volume daily.
2.	Monthly Trend for total orders: Created a line chart that illustrates the hourly trend of total orders throughout the day. This chart will allow us to identify peak hours.
3.	Percentage of sales by category: Created a pie chart that shows the distribution of sales across different categories. This chart will provide insights into the popularity of various pizza categories.
4.	Percentage of sales by pizza size: Generated a pie chart that represents the percentage of sales attributed.
5.	Total Pizza sold by category: Created a funnel chart that represents the number of pizzas sold in each category.
6.	Top 5 best sellers by revenue, quantity, and total orders: Created a bar chart highlighting the top 5 best-selling pizzas.
7.	Bottom 5 selling pizzas by revenue, quantity, and total orders: Created a bar chart highlighting the bottom 5 selling pizzas.
